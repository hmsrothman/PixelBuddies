The number 5 that scales the coordinates in the move function needs to be fixed in lieu of the fact that the tiles are no longer 10 by 10. 

FOLLOWING PLS
	one idea is some sort of queue of positions or statuses or move commands?
	or to basically set simon.pos = tracy.pos - <1,0> and then leave some sort of indicator of when a jump should happen
	*****If tracy jumps and hits a wall, what happens to Simon*****


important edge case:
	I am following Tracy
	Tracy jumps and hits wall, sides down and lands on ground
	I follow and jump in the same spot, hit wall in the same spot
	I then land right on Tracy
	Then I walk back to my spot behind her
